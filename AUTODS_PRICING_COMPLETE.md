## 📊 **PRODUCT COST RANGE - PROFIT RULES**

### **Recommended Setup:**

**Rule 1: Low-Cost Items ($0 - $20)**
```
$0 - $20: 50% profit
```
**Why 50%?**
- Higher risk on cheap items
- Need bigger margins to cover fees
- Example: $10 cost → $15 sale → $5 profit

**Rule 2: Mid-Range Items ($20 - $100)**
```
$20 - $100: 40% profit
```
**Why 40%?**
- Sweet spot for most products
- Good balance of profit and competitiveness
- Example: $50 cost → $70 sale → $20 profit

**Rule 3: High-Value Items ($100 - $500)**
```
$100 - $500: 35% profit
```
**Why 35%?**
- Lower margin but higher dollar profit
- More competitive pricing
- Example: $200 cost → $270 sale → $70 profit

**Rule 4: Premium Items ($500+)**
```
$500 - $99999: 30% profit
```
**Why 30%?**
- High-dollar items need competitive pricing
- Still huge profit in absolute terms
- Example: $1000 cost → $1300 sale → $300 profit
