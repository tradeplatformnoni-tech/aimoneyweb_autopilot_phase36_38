## 🎮 How API Keys Work (Simple Version)

**Think of API keys like passwords that let our robots talk to other websites:**

```
YOUR ROBOT (NeoLight)
    ↓
    "Hey Reddit, give me trending topics!"
    ↓
    Uses API KEY (like a password)
    ↓
Reddit checks: "Is this key valid?"
    ↓
    YES ✓
    ↓
Reddit sends back: "Here's what's trending!"
    ↓
YOUR ROBOT receives the data
    ↓
Uses it to make trading decisions
```

### **How to Give Me API Keys:**
1. You create account on website (Reddit, Shopify, etc.)
2. Website gives you API key (like a password)
3. You send me the key
4. I add it to the system (like saving a password)
5. Robots can now use that service!

**Example:**
- You sign up for Reddit API → Get key: `abc123xyz`
- You send me: "Reddit key is abc123xyz"
- I configure it → Robots can now read Reddit!

## 🏪 Why Multiple Platforms = More Money

**The more places you sell, the more money you make!**

```
ONE product listed on:
    ├─ Shopify → $30 sale
    ├─ Poshmark → $30 sale
    ├─ Depop → $30 sale
    ├─ eBay → $30 sale
    └─ Etsy → $30 sale
        ↓
    5 sales = $150 total!
        ↓
    Cost: $10 × 5 = $50
        ↓
    💰 PROFIT: $100!
```

**Instead of:**
```
ONE product on Shopify only:
    └─ $30 sale
        ↓
    Cost: $10
        ↓
    💰 PROFIT: $20
```

**More platforms = More customers = More profit!** 📈
