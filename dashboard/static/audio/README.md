# Ambient Audio Placeholder

Place your looping ambient track here and rename it to `ambient_loop.mp3`.

Recommended format:
- 2–3 minute seamless loop
- 128 kbps or higher MP3 (or update the `<audio>` source in `templates/dashboard.html` if you prefer another format)
- Volume mastered low (-12 LUFS) to sit behind alert sounds

If the file is missing, the dashboard will simply hide the ambient audio toggle.***
