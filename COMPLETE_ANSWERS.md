## ⚠️ 3. Can I Create Accounts for You?

**NO** - I cannot create accounts because:
- I don't have access to external signup systems
- Security/legal restrictions
- You need to verify identity for some services

**What I Did Instead**:
- ✅ Created `ACCOUNT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` with:
  - Step-by-step instructions for each service
  - Exact URLs to visit
  - What credentials you'll get
  - Where to find API keys
- ✅ After you create accounts, provide me the API keys and I'll configure everything

**Quick Start (Free APIs - 30 minutes)**:
1. FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ → Sign up → Get API key
2. NewsAPI: https://newsapi.org/ → Sign up → Get API key  
3. Reddit: reddit.com/prefs/apps → Create app → Get Client ID + Secret
